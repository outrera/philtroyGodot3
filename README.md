Godot 3 conversion of Phil Troy

So I delayed/aborted this conversion a couple of times due to the pure frustration caused by all API changes in Godot 3(it´s all good, I 
do realize why they had to be done), but this time, although still frustrating, I got the core functions (player movement and dialogue 
system) working.

What works:

Dialogue
Moving player

What doesn´t work yet:

Any UI interaction/fx
Player collision

Considering nothing worked at all yesterday, I´m happy about this progress. Looks like I´ll finally be able to resume this project.

I´m slowly going through the documentation for API changes for Godot 3 and it shouldn´t be too hard to fix the rest, just tedious...

Future development:

continue working on improving the engine, now named DIE(Dynamic Interactive Engine)
finish the event systemm
enable Visual Novel style gameplay functionality
write DIElog (Dialogue and Event editor for ADDS)

It´s crucial to have this functionality done before I start working on the actual game.
