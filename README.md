Godot 3 conversion of Phil Troy

So I delayed/aborted this conversion a couple of times due to the pure frustration caused by all API changes in Godot 3(it´s all good, I 
do realize why they had to be done), but this time, although still frustrating, I got the core functions (player movement and dialogue 
system) working.

All functionality from the Godot 2 version is restored, except for the blurred background in dialogues and UI overlays, mainly because I haven´t gotten to it yet.

Future development:

continue working on improving the engine, now named DIE(Dynamic Interactive Engine)
finish the event systemm
enable Visual Novel style gameplay functionality
write DIElog (Dialogue and Event editor for ADDS)

It´s crucial to have this functionality done before I start working on the actual game.
